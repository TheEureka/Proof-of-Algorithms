# Solution-to-Algorithmic-Problems
A collection of my solutions and proofs to various algorithmic problems.

## Some Extra Notes for each Folder:
  - USACO: consists mainly of the passing program for each problem. I just want an online respository of the programs I've written because the USACO webpage doesn't record submissions in the analysis mode. Sometimes, if I think the problem is hard enough so that some observations aren't very easy to make, I'll probably add a solution file.
